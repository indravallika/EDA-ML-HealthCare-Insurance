# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Modeling to make Predictions of Healthcare and Insurance Data

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare insurance data to understand the key factors influencing insurance costs and to develop predictive models for estimating medical expenses. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights that help both insurance companies and individuals make informed decisions.

## Problem Statement
Medical insurance costs vary significantly based on demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and geographical location. Understanding these variables can help insurance providers set fair pricing policies and assist individuals in assessing their expected medical expenses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains demographic and health-related attributes, which impact medical insurance costs.

### Features:
- **Age**: The age of the insured individual (numerical feature).
- **Sex**: The gender of the insured (categorical: Male/Female).
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight (numerical feature).
- **Children**: Number of dependents covered under the insurance plan (numerical feature).
- **Smoker**: Whether the insured is a smoker or not (categorical: Yes/No).
- **Region**: The geographical region where the insured resides (categorical: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).
- **Charges**: The total medical insurance cost incurred by the individual (numerical target variable).

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify key trends and relationships in the dataset.
2. **Feature Analysis**: Assess how different variables impact insurance costs.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use graphs and charts to gain deeper insights into the dataset.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict healthcare insurance costs.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of different models.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (if any) and checking for inconsistencies.
- Encoding categorical variables into numerical form.
- Standardizing numerical features for better model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summary of the dataset.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
- Visualizing data distributions and patterns using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Creating new relevant features to improve predictive accuracy.
- Selecting the most important features based on correlation and impact analysis.

### 4. Model Development
- Implementing multiple regression-based models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Using performance metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-Squared (RÂ²) Score
- Comparing different models to identify the best-performing one.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key factors that drive variations in medical insurance costs.
- Insights into how smoking, obesity, and other demographic factors affect premiums.
- A predictive model capable of estimating insurance charges based on user input.
- Data-driven recommendations for insurance companies to refine their pricing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning modeling and evaluation)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-insurance-eda.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
